{"pred": "System: It is a great movie. I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: I think it would be better to watch the first of the Fallen movies, which is Olympus Had Fallen even though it is old, but if you end up liking it, you can then watch the movie that came out this year. How does that sound?"}
{"pred": "System: Well I think you will enjoy it.", "label": "System: I agree, the movie before might set the tone and help me better undersand Angel has fallen."}
