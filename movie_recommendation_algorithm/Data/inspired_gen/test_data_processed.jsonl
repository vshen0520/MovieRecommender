And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...", "I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind.", "I have heard really good things about Looper, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it... What're the other two like?", "Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled detective story. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece.", "Pardon the rhyme, but The Hateful Eight was great. Movies with Tarantino involved usually aren't really everyone's cup of tea, but I found the interactions between the characters and the mysteries surrounding them to be really intriguing.", "I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly.", "I'm not sure which I'd rank as my favorite, but The Hateful Eight is definitely up there. That and the Kill Bill duology, which are probably two of the nerdiest action movies I've ever seen. Can't help but love 'em. Speaking of Tarantino, do you know if Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood (gog that title's a pain to type out) was any good?", "It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found.", "Were you looking for a specific trailer, or just any trailer for the movie? Cause if it's the latter, I could just search it on YouTube.", "Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though.", "Throw it at me. And, yeah, I'll accept the recommendation for Once Upon A Time I'm Not Typing Out The Full Title Again. Was already pretty interested in that movie, and hearing that it is indeed pretty good makes me wanna watch it more.", "I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like.", "That... also looks really interesting, dang. Definitely accepting that recommendation too. Thanks for the talk, man. Glad to have given you the opportunity to share some nice-lookin' films!", "You're very welcome. Glad to meet you! Hopefully you enjoy Once Upon a Time as much as I did!"], "resp": "", "rec": [], "entity": [7565, 917, 5014, 15642, 11163, 6174, 4901, 16429, 3503, 4015, 11955, 8376, 11194, 5306, 1216, 7239, 1491, 15720, 4473]}

Under my point of view, it is the most beautiful and meaningful movie ever made, did you watch it ?", "No, I haven't. Wasn't there also a more recent movie with that name, with the aliens?", "I haven't heard about a new one, but that one is something worth to spend couple of hours watching. It has a great great message, it is very interesting, her performance is tremendous and it leaves you a good taste. I recommend you to watch it, and you will evaluate it by yourself", "Sure. One quick question though, what's the genre?", "Drama, even thou it has lots of action and technology", "Awesome. I'll see if I can get the chance to check it out.", "Great! you won't regret it, I can bet", "Alright. Can I get a second reccomendation, actually? Not because the first one is bad by any means, just need an additional one :D", "Well, another picture I enjoyed a lot, which is less profound, but with a great message too is Juno, it is very light but with very good story, have you watched it ?", "I've definitely at least heard of it, I think. Was it an animated movie by any chance?", "No, it is about a girl who gets pregnant at 16 and it starts a big drama with a happy ending.
