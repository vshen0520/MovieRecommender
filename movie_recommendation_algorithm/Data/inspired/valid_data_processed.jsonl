Murder mystery is exactly what I'm looking for, can you tell me a little more about the movie?", "The movie follows a group of friends who participate in a couples game night every week. Maxs brother hosts a murder the stakes get invariably raised when he gets kidnapped. As Max, Annie and their competitive couple-friends set out to solve the mystery and rescue Brooks, they discover something unknown about Brooks and the game. The movie received praise for its tight plotting that delivered genuinely shocking twists and turns and its ability to land silly humor at the same time.", "That sounds pretty interesting, I might have to check it out. Does it have a romance plot in the movie?", "Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams play Max and Annie who are a couple in the movie.", "That's good, I enjoy movies that have a romantic touch to them. You know what? You've convinced me, I am definitely going to watch this movie. I accept your recommendation!", "That's marvelous. I hope you enjoy it.", "Thanks! If I enjoy that movie, are there any others that I should check out?", "Do you like older mystery movies? Or the newer ones only?", "I like both! But I'm interested in hearing about older ones", "You would probably like Mirror Crack'd if you like Agatha Christie. Angela Lansbury play's Miss Marple in a quaint British town. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor in her last role and Tony Curtis are, also lead roles in this mystery movie.", "Those sound very cool, do they have a lot of action in them?", "Probably no as much as you the would like with Angela Lansbury. You might like Murder on the Orient Express better with Poirot.", "I think I've heard of that one. It has Judi Dench right? I enjoy her movies a lot. Does that movie have a good cast with her?", "It has the following cast: Olivia Colman, Penlope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr., Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer, Lucy Boynton, and Johnny Depp. You be the judge of the cast."], "resp": "That sounds very good!

Or was that a different director?", "Motherless Brooklyn was directed by Edward Norton. Starring Bruce Willis", "Okay, I must have been thinking about an interview with Scorcese that mentioned Motherless Brooklyn. Did Motherless Brooklyn receive positive reviews?", "One critic said it requires a lot of patience to watch, but it has strong performances, and an interesting perspective. Most of the critics say it's an average movie.", "How has The Irishman been received critically?", "The ratings are pretty high, most people giving it around eight out of ten stars. One person called it an epic gangster drama. Sounds kind of typical for a Scorsese film", "Okay, I accept your recommendation, I would be interested in watching the trailer for The Irishman", "Great, I hope you enjoy it."], "resp": "Thanks for the recommendation!", "rec": [], "entity": [1216, 1187, 1828, 293, 14981, 2504, 4937, 10927, 9881, 1721, 15668, 7574, 7063, 8376, 4473, 475]}

{"context": ["", "Hi, I am here to help you find a movie trailer you would enjoy.", "Awesome, sounds great. I'm looking for some great movie recommendations. I'm a huge fan of horror movies.", "I will be glad to help. Horror movies are my favorite too. Is there a specific type of horror movies you enjoy?", "So glad you asked. Yes there is. I like monster movies, like The Thing, and sci-fi horror movies like Underworld, and Dracula 2000. I grew up watching those types of movies. Not into movies like Saw and The Purge. Horror movies with good plots, lots of action and suspense, and eventually at the end of the movie, how the animal or monster is caught and obliterated.", "I love sci-fi horror too! All of those are great movies. I particularly like the Alien movies. Sygourney Weaver is a fantastic actress.", "It's amazing you should say that about the Alien movies. I've seen every last one of them, including the last one, but I'm still having a hard time trying to figure out what REALLY happened to Walter and David on Alien: Covenant. Sygourney Weaver is an awesome actress, I do agree. I personally really do enjoy movies where people turn into monsters, like the old movie, The Beast Within. It's kinda cheesy, but it does have a great story line to it. Waiting on a part two. Good to know that we share something in common!", "I have seen all of them as well! Personally, regarding Alien: Covenant, I think that there is a chance that Walter is still alive since he had the ability to heal himself. I'm not so sure about David. Maybe they will continue the story. I hope so. Old monster movies are great too. I love cheese as food and in my movies. If you love movies like that I would suggest Pumpkinhead. It's an excellent cult classic!", "Hmmm...I've seen a trailer or two for Pumpkinhead. I do enjoy cult classics like that. I think I will possibly take your recommendation on watching it. As a matter of fact, I'll see if I can find where I can buy it so I can watch it without commercials. And yeah, I do hope they continue the story with David and Walter. It is probably a chance that Walter is still alive. But thank you so much for your suggestion and recommendation, I greatly appreciate it.", "I am glad I could help you find something you are interested in! If they do more Alien movies I will be there to watch them for sure. It was no problem at all. Pumpkinhead really is a great movie. I hope you enjoy it!", "Thanks again. I will I'm sure I will.", "I have found the trailer I believe", "Oh goody...!! I most definitely will! Nice chatting with you!", "You too", "Do you have any additional recommendations?", "Now that you mention it I do!", "Hmm....awesome. Hit me with them because I want to find something new and different. I've seen the Avengers, including Halloween, Maleficent with Angelina Jolie, Gretel and Hansel (Not the new movie but the TV Syfy version), Jaws (all of them), Halloween (all of them except for the very last one), all of the Underworld movies, I've seen a LOT of movies including all of the Jeepers Creepers movies. We can go way back to The Omen movies, and movies with Vincent Price!", "You really do have great taste in movies. The Halloween and Jeepers Creepers movies are some of my all time favorite series. If you would like to go old school I would suggest House Of Wax", "House of Wax? Thats a great movie. I've seen it but I would watch it again.", "It is a great movie.

What do you like Tom Hanks and his films?", "Honestly, I like that he is a very versatile actor, the fact that he can work in animated movies and realistic narratives is absolutely astounding to me!", "I agree completely! His work in movies so serious, such as Captain Philips, and animated children's films, such as the Toy Story movie, shows how versatile he can be.", "I really enjoy his films but I haven't seen them all! What are some of your other favorites?", "Some of my favorites are the Toy Story movies, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, and Cast Away. Have you seen all of those?", "ooo yes Castaway is one of my all time favorites! WILSONNNN LOL!! But i've never seen Forrest Gump, is that about the shrimp company?", "Yes! Part of the movie does include his work with the shrimp company, known as Bubba Gump Shrimp. Would you like me to explain a little more about it to see if you would be interested?", "Awesome I love the restaurants! Is the movie a tearjerker like Philadelphia? Or is it light and happy like Toy Story?", "It has a little bit of both! Happy and funny moments but also some very serious and sad. I feel like this movie would really appeal to you!", "It sounds like a real rollercoaster ride! What exactly does the plot of the film entail?", "The movie is all about the life of our protagonist, Forrest Gump. It begins with him as a boy growing up in Alabama. Throughout the movie, you witness his incredible journey of success. I will not spoil it, but much of the story includes love, the Vietnam War, and fame. I really think you would love this movie!", "Oh Alabama...? In what year does the movie take place? Are there aspects of racism within the film?", "The movie begins with Forrest as a boy during the 1950's then takes you throughout his life until about 1980. There are aspects of racism within the film that do coincide with some of the negative views that took place during those times. The film absolutely does not agree with any of the negative views that some characters exemplify.", "For me that is a good thing, I enjoy learning about historical events regarding the strife between races, but from reading your synopsis of the movie, I truly believe I would enjoy this film and I appreciate your recommendation! I plan on watching tonight with a bottle of red wine and some buttered popcorn :)", "Oh my sounds like a good night! Maybe I will re-watch it with a bottle of cabernet sauvignon. Quarantine life has been tough, but movies are keeping me going. The movie will definitely give you some motivation to get through the tough times.", "Omg yes, I've been so bored during this quarantine, every good recommendation is worth it! Do you know if Forrest Gump is on netflix?", "It used to be on Netflix, although they took it off. I am sure you can find it online somewhere for a small fee!"], "resp": "Okay definitely worth it!
